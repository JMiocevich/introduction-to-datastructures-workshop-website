Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that is made up of a bunch of nodes that are linked together. Each node has a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. The last node in the list has a pointer to null.

What sucks about array
- deletion
- insertion
- ungrowable*

- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
